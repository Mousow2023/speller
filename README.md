# CS50x Speller

## Overview
The Speller project is part of Harvard's CS50x course, where the goal is to implement a spell checker that can efficiently check the spelling of words using a hash table. This project enhances understanding of data structures, algorithms, and memory management in C.

## Features
- **Dictionary Loading:** Loads a dictionary of words from a file into memory using a hash table.
- **Spell Checking:** Checks the spelling of words input by the user against the loaded dictionary.
- **Performance Metrics:** Measures the time taken to load the dictionary and check the words, providing insights into the efficiency of the algorithm.
